## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with hands-on experience in building modern, scalable web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Node.js. My development stack is powered by clean code, performance-first approach, and a strong sense of user experience.

I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy solving complex problems, and love experimenting with new technologies — from building chat systems with Socket.io to exploring AI integration with tools like Gemini (Operoutre).
